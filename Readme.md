## German Turoial/Insights
If you're interested in reading about the things we use, there is a dev log file that describes problems and other topics we came across in german: [here]((https://github.com/FWidm/FlashCardsAPI/blob/master/_Docs/PlayDokuFabian.md)).

## TODO

## Example Calls
### Users
**Elements needed for REST calls:**
-*String*: name, password, email
- *int*: rating

**Create a new User:**
Use a `POST`  request to `localhost:9000/users` with `Content-Type:Application/JSON`.  The body **must** contain name, password, email (*unique*) and **may** contain a rating.
```json
{
    "name": "name",
    "password": "passw√∂rd",
    "email": "a@a.com",
    "rating": 1
}
```

### Groups
**Elements needed for REST calls:**
- *String*: name, description
- *Array of users*: users

**Create a new Group:**
Post a request to the host with `Content-Type:Application/JSON`.
The body **must** contain name and description and **may** contain a list of users.

`POST localhost:9000/groups`
```json
{
    "name":"xyxxxx",
    "description": "desc",
    "users":[{"userId":8},{"userId":9}]
}
```

**Update a Group:**
Send a `PATCH`or `PUT` request to `localhost:9000/groups/<id>` with `Content-Type:Application/JSON`.  For `PATCH`**any** attributes may be modified via the request. `PUT` expects **every** attribute to be there.

**Delete a Group:**
Use `DELETE` request to `localhost:9000/groups/<id>`.
