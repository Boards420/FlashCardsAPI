## German Tutorial/Insights
If you're interested in reading about the things we use, there is a dev log file that describes problems and other topics we came across in German: [here](https://github.com/FWidm/FlashCardsAPI/blob/master/_Docs/PlayDokuFabian.md).


## Example Calls
### Users
**Elements needed for REST calls:**
- **String**: name, password, email
- **int**: rating

**Create a new User:**
Use a `POST`  request to `localhost:9000/users` with `Content-Type:Application/JSON`.  The body **must** contain name, password, email (*unique*) and **may** contain a rating.
```json
{
    "name": "name",
    "password": "passw√∂rd",
    "email": "a@a.com",
    "rating": 1
}
```

### Groups
**Elements needed for REST calls:**
- **String**: name, description
- **Array of users**: users

**Create a new Group:**
Post a request to the host with `Content-Type:Application/JSON`.
The body **must** contain name and description and **may** contain a list of users.

`POST localhost:9000/groups`
```json
{
    "name":"xyxxxx",
    "description": "desc",
    "users":[{"userId":8},{"userId":9}]
}
```

**Update a Group:**
Send a `PATCH`or `PUT` request to `localhost:9000/groups/<id>` with `Content-Type:Application/JSON`.  For `PATCH`**any** attributes may be modified via the request. `PUT` expects **every** attribute to be there.

**Delete a Group:**
Use `DELETE` request to `localhost:9000/groups/<id>`.

### Flashcards
**Elements needed for Rest calls:**
- **int**: rating
- **question** - either a complete object as seen here or the `questionId`
- **answers** - an array of complete answer objects or `answerIds`

**Example**: Creates one new card with new question, answers, tags all from the same author (with userId=1).
```json
{
    "rating": 0,
    "question": {
      "questionText": "hello world!",
      "uri": "www.google.de",
      "author": {
        "userId": 1
      }
    },
    "answers": [
      {
        "answerText": "answer",
        "answerHint": "hint",
        "uri": "www.answer.com",
        "author": {
            "userId":1
        }
      }
    ],
    "author": {
      "userId": 1
    },
    "multipleChoice": false,
    "marked": false,
    "selected": false,
    "tags":[{
              "tagName": "tag1"
    }]
  }
```

### Ratings
**Elements needed for Rest calls**
- **Author**: userId
- **Answer**: answerId **or** a complete new answer
- **Flashcard**: Flashcard
- **ratingModifier**: how should the rating value change (e.g. +1,-1)

**Example**: Create a Rating made by the author with userId=1 for the answer with answerId=1 that modifies the rating by -1.
```json
{
  "ratingId": 1,
  "author": {
    "userId": 1
  },
  "ratingModifier": -1,
  "answer": {
    "answerId": 1
    }
  }
```

### CardDecks

**Example**: Create a Carddeck with a specific cardDeckName, a description saying "", two FlashCards (can be an empty list), one UserGroup (mandatory).
```json
{
    "cardDeckName": "{{cardDeckName}}",
    "cardDeckDescpription": "",
    "cards": [
              {
        "flashcardId": 1
      },
      {
        "flashcardId": 2
      }
    ],
    "userGroup":{
        "groupId":1
    }
}
```

### Categories
The hierarchy of the categories looks like this:
```
root (parent=null)
  |-level 1 (parent=root)
    |-level 2 (parent=level 1)
      |-level 3 (parent=level 2)
        |-level 4 (parent=level 3)
  |-level 1' (parent=root)
  |-level 1'' (parent=root)
    |-level 2' (parent=level 1'')
```
But there is no rule to only have one root, more than one root directory is planned.
**Example**: creates a new category with a name, an array of carddecks and a parent that decides the tree structure.
```json
{
  "categoryName": "Name",
  "cardDecks": [
    {
      "cardDeckId": 1
    }],
  "parent": {"categoryId": 1}
}
```
